# Software Subsystem GitHub Issues 2025

This repository logs all issues and technical decisions for the software subsystem for the 2025-2026 design cycle.

  
There are 3 types of issues:
- Epics (goals - 1-2 months)
- Stories (individual features, 1-2 weeks)
- Task (individual tasks, a few hours of work)

This repository will also be where we work on and log major technical decisions. Logged decisions will also be typed up in Google Docs and linked.

This repository will be made public at the end of our design cycle.
